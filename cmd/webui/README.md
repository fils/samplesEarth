# IGSN server test

## Main

Simple page to describe the following sub-domains

## allocator.samples.earth

example allocator, I wont show a real allocator since 
this is the hard part of find out what APIs a community

Need a tool here to build the test sitemaps (likely not
usable by others..)

## register.samples.earth

register via web arch and provide master provider list.
Try and use Gleaner to build the index.


## portalone.samples.earth

demonstrate an allocator portal...  since any allocator likely 
wishes to expose their own holdings

## portaltwo.samples.earth

demonstrate a portal, which will aggregate and search
